# The-loss-function-curve-is-abnormal
The loss of validation set is lower than that of training set

The training process image is shown below, and the two problems that appear are normal well.

（1）This is me using UA-DETAC data set to take an image every 20 frames to form a training verification set. Training is that the loss of the verification set is always less than the loss of the training set until after 100 rounds. Using the pre-training weight, excuse me, is this normal.

（2）Is it normal for the training set to drop slightly and the verification set to remain basically the same.
